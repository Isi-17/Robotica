# Occupancy-gridmap-building-with-laser-2D
In this repository you will find the opcional project of the **[Robotics subject](https://github.com/MarkosHB/Robotics-Subject)** at the **[University of MÃ¡laga](https://www.uma.es/#gsc.tab=0)** fully implemented by the student of Computer Science **[Marcos Hidalgo](https://github.com/MarkosHB)**. Our goal is to implement the needed functionality so a robot moving in an environment can build an occupancy gridmap of it.

Some considerations of the project:
- A 2D laser simulator is provided.
- The environment is defined with lines.
- Localization is known.
- In order to build the map, the robot has to move within it.
